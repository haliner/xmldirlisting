 What Exactly Does xmldirlisting?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The xmldirlisting project allows you to easily generate an XML file, which
 contains the directory listing of the current working directory. The scripts
 travels downwards the whole directory tree recursively and gathers information
 about the files and directories. The resulting XML tree can be manipulated and
 processed with other tools. There are also example files included, which are
 showing how to create a HTML directory listing with the help of an XSLT
 stylesheet processor (will be discussed later).

 Please note, that the script needs a Python 3 interpreter installed. Most
 distributions are shipping Python 2 interpreters, but they optionally provide
 also the newer ones. Because the script was written with the Python 3 syntax
 in mind, another interpreter would probably fail. So if your interpreter
 complains about syntax errors, check your interpreters' version at first.

 What's Included?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * xmldirlisting:
                  Python 3 script, produces XML dirlisting

 * dirlisting.*:
                  Example files for use with an XML/XSLT processor.


 How Should I Install the Script?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 There are no special needs --- you might even not install the xmldirlisting
 script and instead run it within the source distribution. But most likely you
 want to install it in some way into your system. For that you can use the
 setup.py script.


 How to Invoke?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The script will generate for the current working directory, so you probably
 want to change it first. Executing the script will then make it print the
 xml data to it's standard output.

 Example usage:

   ./xmldirlisting >dirlisting.xml


 How Can I Further Process the XML file?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 One example usage is the creation of an HTML dirlisting, which gives access
 to all files of a directory. The example files include in the source
 distribution are exactly doing this. You need an XSLT processor like
 xmlstarlet, Xalan or other similar tools.

 Example usage:

   ./xmldirlisting >dirlisting.xml
   xmlstarlet tr dirlisting.xslt dirlisting.xml >index.html

 The file `index.html.' will now contain a full hyperlinked and HTML directory
 listing. It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and of course XSLT for generating the
 HTML file. Extending the template file might be a good start for your own
 solution.
